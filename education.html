<p><font size="5" font face="georgia">During my elementary and primary, I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Long Gafar and Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Long Gafar. Both schools are located side by side to each other and were separated by the wall closed to the canteen. Both schools are located for like 3KM from my house. I have experienced many different types of transportation to go to the schools and going home. From hopping in school bus, car, motorcycle, to the cycling, and even walking. </font></p>
